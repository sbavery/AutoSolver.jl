TOPO_0DOT5.TXT - the resolution of this file is 0.5 degrees
                 in latitude and longitude.This file should 
                 be used with a bi-cubic interpolation

Coordinates of the grid points in the previous files    
TOPOLAT.TXT - Latitudes

The file contains 2 overlapping extra rows on the top 
and on the bottom and 2 overlapping columns on the right 
and on the left. This is to facilitate the use of the 
bicubic interpolation to derive the height 
for any given coordinates. 

An additional file, TOPO_1DOT5_REV1.TXT, is supplied 
not to be used to derive the altitude of a site but only 
to give a reference, with the same resolution of other 
datafiles in the ITU-R Recommendations (resolution 1.5 
by 1.5 degrees). The coordinates of the gridpoints 
in this file are contained in:
ESALAT.TXT - Latitudes
ESALON.TXT - Longitudes
